###### *BWCA trip from this summer*

#### Summer.

Over the summer I have worked very hard to learn a ton of things about web development and have improved my skills significantly.  I made a few projects such as my own [personal website](https://www.jackbaude.com), a website for a friend [Erick Votava](https://erickvotava.photos), and one of my larger projects that I am actively working on: a [wiki](https://technicalmc.xyz) for a small community of minecraft which I play in. The wiki project has been a lot of work and I have found a few people in the community to help me. I've written roughly 30,000 lines of code in the past month and a half and have learned plenty. As of the moment I'm trying to figure out how to do authentication which is proving to be a paranoid and daunting process and much more complex than I estimated it to be. I do hope to keep putting lots of work into this project as well as working on my school related rust work.

#### First week of school.

This is the first week of school and I have started to install some of the programs and IDES that I will need in order to do [rust-lang ](https://www.rust-lang.org/)development. 

Some of the ideas that I am thinking of doing is making my own [rust cargo](https://crates.io/) package. It would be a new experience of making a package for any language. I have no idea what I would like to make but that is far out because learning the language is the first step. Rust is a low level programming language that has recently blown up for its performance for memory handling as well as parallelism. Learning the language will be my first delve into low level programming where my control over memory and threads is much more than any other language I have worked with.
