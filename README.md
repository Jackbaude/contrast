This site is a public place where I can go through my learning and what I have done while learning rust. This is my first delve into lower level programming where I learn how to code, and think, in rust. So far it has been very facsinating to learn about memeory management and what is going on at a lower level. I am learning at my own pace through an independt computer science study that I am doing through my high school. I plan to learn as much as I can the first semester and maybe work on a few small projects and examples. Then later in the second semester, later winter, I will apply as much as I know to a larger project or library. The updates may not be updated regualry but rather when I feel that I have learned something signifigant enough to post about.
